# Predicting-Price-of-Bitcoin-using-Monte-Carlo-Simulation
This project predicts Bitcoin prices using Monte Carlo simulation, modeling multiple possible outcomes to estimate the most probable price. To handle the heavy computation, we use High Performance Computing (HPC) with MPI for parallel processing. Future scope includes integrating market sentiment analysis for improved accuracy.
